To Do:
Figure out how to push information from frontend to backend server and display it (for submitting questions)
Right now we can display it in a console

Added Questions.jade in api/views/ just for fun (actually may not be useful for our app...)
removed unused "import" statement in App.js, LoginForm, NavigationBar, and Question to remove warnings
removed unused SampleQuestion in App.js
changed ComponentWillMount to ComponentDidMount in App.js and Question.js to remove a warning
in Question.js:
    added handleChange and handleSubmit to Question class
    changed Question class's state to add the above two functions
    in the input tag in form:
        changed "value={this.state.value}" to "value={this.state.word}"
