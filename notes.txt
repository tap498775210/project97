To Do:
Remove commented codes and the debugging console.log functions before final submission
Deal with "xxx is defined but never used" warnings before final submission 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

minor changes of css and display.

file changed:
    App.css and Sidebar.css     
        changed the position of navbar, sidebar, and the sidebar toggle button to fixed. 
        new changes that are involved with position change are seperated with the original
        styles with a line. 
    App.js      
        changed classname of the main body: if the sidebar is present, then use the class 
        "main-body-w-bar". Might not be the clever way but it works.  
    Sidebar.js
        Removed router
    AnswerTable.js
        Added key
    Register.js
        Changed form placeholder text


added login/logout feature such that user will not be signed out when page is refreshed.
user's login (username and userId) is now stored in localStorage.
only signout from user's profile page will signout from Qiazza.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

added form verification for creating posts. Alerts will now appear when title, content,
or both are emtpy.
also changed creating post feature in Question.js to submit and refresh after submission occurs.
previous commit had a bug that did not allow new posts to be submitted, frontend never POST to
backend.
need to fix issue where sidebar doesn't extend down to bottom of screen after loading the questions.
    possible solutions:
    render sidebar after main body
    add scrolling to QuestionTable
will probably go with scrolling QuestionTable


added user for created posts. Login required, otherwise posts could not be created. 
    (there is a hardcoded userId in Question's state, feel free to use it to avoid logging 
    in everytime we recompile the app)
The course for created posts is still hardcoded for now. Ideas are in the following paragraph. 

added create post feature in Question, but not fully implemented. Each created post has 
only a title, content, course, while the course is hardcoded. It requires reloading the 
page to render newly created post. 
plan: hardcode some checkbox for courses in the form, like ⬜CS 97  ⬜CS 33,
    to let the user choose which course is related to this post. 
    Then setState the selected course id. 
    checkbox reference:  https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html (Ctrl F "checkbox")
    bootstrap reference: https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/forms/#forms-check-inline

pass both title and post id to QuestionTable so it can redirect to /q/[post id]

In Question.js: Used a temporary function to display question titles
functions for creating posts not implemented yet
Copied files from branch jc:
   api/bin/www
   api/package.json (keep both hbs and jade)
   api/models/model-comment.js
   api/models/model-post.js
   api/models/model-user.js
   api/routes/comments.js
   api/routes/course.js
   api/routes/posts.js
   api/routes/users.js
The difference of /api between two branches before copy is in apidiff_before.diff


Show sidebar by default in a computer screen 

Added an input box in /questionAPI for inputing question contents. Not functional yet. 

Merged conflict with the last commit. Hope I didn't break anything. Will double check tomorrow!
Added "userId" to App class's state. It will be the user id after login.
Question accepts userId as a parameter as well. 
Because the above implementations requires passing a function from App to LoginForm 
and passing a value from App to Question, 
the quickest way to do it right now is to render <LoginForm /> directly from App, 
so the routes array and the <Route /> parts in both App and Sidebar are modified. 


Added collapsable sidebar in App.js
removed NavigationBar.js and NavigationBar.css since it is no longer needed

Fixed linking between backend and frontend, question table submission works again
updated /api/app.js to use the old questionAPI route that is still necessary
fixed /api/routes/questionAPI.js apparantly it got reverted to an older version


Added a search bar in /search
In Question.js: moved functions for QuestionTable to QuestionTable.js
Fixed some typo 

In login page: Changed the text in the message box 
                Changed the width of the message box for devices with a small screen

Changed the question list to a table, so we are able to add more columns in each row if needed 


Darwin:
removed unused files in main folder
created Sidebar.js and Sidebar.css for cleaner App.js and to make it easier to modify just the Sidebar
moved routes array into routes.js and imported into relevant files
updated sidebar css to stretch full width of page
fixed sidebar links not displaying test message when clicked


Added Questions.jade in api/views/ just for fun (actually may not be useful for our app...)
removed unused "import" statement in App.js, LoginForm, NavigationBar, and Question to remove warnings
removed unused SampleQuestion in App.js
changed ComponentWillMount to ComponentDidMount in App.js and Question.js to remove a warning
in Question.js:
    added handleChange and handleSubmit to Question class
    changed Question class's state to add the above two functions
    in the input tag in form:
        changed "value={this.state.value}" to "value={this.state.word}"
