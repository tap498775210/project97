Merged conflict with the last commit. Hope I didn't break anything. Will double check tomorrow!
Added "userId" to App class's state. It will be the user id after login.
Question accepts userId as a parameter as well. 
Because the above implementations requires passing a function from App to LoginForm 
and passing a value from App to Question, 
the quickest way to do it right now is to render <LoginForm /> directly from App, 
so the routes array and the <Route /> parts in both App and Sidebar are modified. 
Plans for Question: get the posts from backend


Added collapsable sidebar in App.js
removed NavigationBar.js and NavigationBar.css since it is no longer needed

Fixed linking between backend and frontend, question table submission works again
updated /api/app.js to use the old questionAPI route that is still necessary
fixed /api/routes/questionAPI.js apparantly it got reverted to an older version


Added a search bar in /search
In Question.js: moved functions for QuestionTable to QuestionTable.js
Fixed some typo 

In login page: Changed the text in the message box 
                Changed the width of the message box for devices with a small screen

Changed the question list to a table, so we are able to add more columns in each row if needed 


Darwin:
removed unused files in main folder
created Sidebar.js and Sidebar.css for cleaner App.js and to make it easier to modify just the Sidebar
moved routes array into routes.js and imported into relevant files
updated sidebar css to stretch full width of page
fixed sidebar links not displaying test message when clicked


Added Questions.jade in api/views/ just for fun (actually may not be useful for our app...)
removed unused "import" statement in App.js, LoginForm, NavigationBar, and Question to remove warnings
removed unused SampleQuestion in App.js
changed ComponentWillMount to ComponentDidMount in App.js and Question.js to remove a warning
in Question.js:
    added handleChange and handleSubmit to Question class
    changed Question class's state to add the above two functions
    in the input tag in form:
        changed "value={this.state.value}" to "value={this.state.word}"
