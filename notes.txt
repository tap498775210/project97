To Do:
Figure out how to push information from frontend to backend server and display it (for submitting questions)
Right now we can display it in a console

Darwin:
removed unused files in main folder
created Sidebar.js and Sidebar.css for cleaner App.js and to make it easier to modify just the Sidebar
moved routes array into routes.js and imported into relevant files
updated sidebar css to stretch full width of page
fixed sidebar links not displaying test message when clicked


Added Questions.jade in api/views/ just for fun (actually may not be useful for our app...)

removed unused SampleQuestion in App.js
changed ComponentWillMount to ComponentDidMount in App.js and Question.js to remove a warning
in Question.js:
    added handleChange and handleSubmit to Question class
    changed Question class's state to add the above two functions
    in the input tag in form:
        changed "value={this.state.value}" to "value={this.state.word}"
